# RESTful API For Job Listing Platform

## Description

This project is a RESTful API implementation of a job listing platform, inspired by services like Upwork. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate my skills and understanding of web development and API design. The platform offers the following basic features:

- **User Profiles:** Users can create and manage their profiles, providing essential information.
- **Job Postings:** Employers can create job listings with details such as descriptions, requirements, and compensation.
- **Job Applications:** Freelancers can browse job listings and submit applications.
- **Digital Wallet:** Each user receives a digital wallet upon registration, allowing simulated transactions.
- **Review System:** Users can leave reviews for each other after successful job completion.

## API Documentation

I have documented this API using the OpenAPI Specification 3.0.0 format. You can find the complete API documentation [here](documentation).

## Database Design

The project includes a database to store user information, job listings, transactions, and reviews. Below is a simplified representation of the database structure:

## CI/CD

I used GitHub Action for CI/CD.

## Future Improvements

There's always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- **Rating System:** Implement a rating system to enhance user feedback and trust.
- **Adding Tags to Jobs:** Allow users to categorize and discover jobs more effectively.
- **Job Recommendation System:** Explore the possibility of providing job recommendations based on user preferences and skills.
