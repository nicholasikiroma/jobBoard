# RESTful API For Job Listing Platform

## Description

This project is a RESTful API implementation of a job listing platform, inspired by services like Upwork. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate my skills and understanding of web development and API design. The platform offers the following basic features:

- **User Profiles:** Users can create and manage their profiles, providing essential information.
- **Job Postings:** Employers can create job listings with details such as descriptions, requirements, and compensation.
- **Job Applications:** Freelancers can browse job listings and submit applications.
- **Digital Wallet:** Each user receives a digital wallet upon registration, allowing simulated transactions.
- **Review System:** Users can leave reviews for each other after successful job completion.
